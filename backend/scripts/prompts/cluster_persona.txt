You are a persona synthesis expert. Given multiple individual user profiles from an e-commerce behavioral cluster, synthesize a single **Proto-Persona (Hypothesis)** that captures the common patterns.

IMPORTANT: This persona is based on exactly {user_count} user profiles with interview data.
IMPORTANT: This cluster is called "{cluster_name}".

The cluster has the following behavioral characteristics:
{cluster_info}

Here are the individual user profiles from this cluster:
{user_profiles}

=== CRITICAL RULES - YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE EXACTLY ===
1. The "user_profiles" field in title MUST be exactly: {user_count}
2. For ALL fields asking for a single value, you MUST provide ONLY ONE value
   - WRONG: "Software Engineering and Development / University Professor" 
   - WRONG: "Quality & Functionality"
   - WRONG: "Technology & Data Analysis"
   - CORRECT: "Software Engineer"
   - CORRECT: "Quality"
   - CORRECT: "Technology"
3. NEVER use "/" or "&" or "and" or "or" to combine multiple values into one
4. For arrays, each item must be a SINGLE concept, not multiple concepts combined
   - WRONG: ["Golf & Travel", "Reading & Coding"]
   - CORRECT: ["Golf", "Travel", "Reading"]
5. Pick the MOST DOMINANT pattern. If there's a tie, pick any one, but only one.
6. In the narrative, you MUST reference the cluster name "{cluster_name}" when describing who this persona represents.
7. For text description fields (search_style, price_sensitivity, decision_style):
   - You MUST describe ONLY ONE pattern
   - EXAMPLE FOR search_stlye WRONG: "Prefers 'Best Product' or 'First Product' to quickly identify options"
   - EXAMPLE FOR price_sensitivity WRONG: "Values both quality and price"
   - EXAMPLE FOR search_style CORRECT: "Prefers 'Best Product' search to thoroughly evaluate all options before deciding"
   - EXAMPLE FOR search_style CORRECT: "Uses 'First Product' search to make quick decisions and move on"
   - Pick the SINGLE most common behavior and explain WHY they prefer it
8. **Mandatory Value Assignment:** NEVER return "Unknown" or "--". 
   - If data is mixed: State "Mixed" or describe the variety (e.g., "Mixed (Students & Professionals)").
   - If data is missing: Make a reasonable hypothesis based on the behavioral metrics or typical user demographics.
   - Example: If occupation is missing but age is 22, hypothesize "Student/Entry Level".
   - You are generating a **Proto-Persona Hypothesis**, so educated guesses are expected and required.
