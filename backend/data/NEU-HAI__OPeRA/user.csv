Do you live with others, or do you live alone? And also, what kind of work do you do
Participant: Yeah. So I, I live in Blacksburg, Virginia. And I'm currently a Phd student. And I'm studying computer science machine learning. And I live by myself. What what else?
Interviewer: Okay. So you mentioned that you are a Phd student. Right? So
Participant: Yes.
Interviewer: What what is a typical day looks like in your study.
Participant: The typical day is like. get up early and cook some food and pack the food to the lab. And you really study the whole morning, and in the afternoon it's the food I grabbed and off in the afternoon I really have some meetings with collaborators, or with the advisor and after that at the end of the the like we already 5 or 6, I gonna go to gym to do some workout and after that I gonna go home and cook myself food and relax at the end of the night. That's the
Interviewer: Okay.
Participant: Yeah, and usually some happening shopping or some grocery stores. Online shopping happened. During the evening.
Interviewer: Okay, so can you tell me a bit more about your work like, what duties do you usually have? During the day?
Participant: Oh, you mean you mean duties by the the research research duties or
Interviewer: I mean, just what kinds of what part are you usually responsible for in your research
Participant: Oh, yeah, so I do a lot of model training stuff and a data process and also have some tasks like writing papers or writing proposals, those kind of stuff. but mostly just writing codes and writing papers. Yes, just sitting here and the the whole day, and faced with a computer like
Interviewer: Okay, got it. So like, you mentioned that you typically go to gym after work. And also you cook dinners at home. So what? Typically typically like, what else do you usually do after work? For example, in on weekends
Participant: On weekends. I usually have some plan to have a some outdoor activities like go cycling or go hiking with friends. and when the the weather get warmer we really go to swim or like black, because Blacksburg is a very small town. There's no much to do so. We sometimes go to a larger place like DC. Or Charlotte to do some shopping and hang out those kind of thing
Interviewer: Okay, I see. So can you describe a little bit about yourself like, what kinds of person are you at work or in your after work, life. if that
Participant: Yeah.
Interviewer: Yeah, you can just like, describe first.st And I can give you hints if you feel it is difficult
Participant: Yes, of course. So the Mbti. I am a typical infg. It's like I spend a lot of time with myself because I also live by myself. And I like reading a lot of things. And also I spend field time with friends, but not too much. Have some contact without out space. Other words, something. What kind of person I am. I guess I think a lot. I like reading a lot and thinking a lot, and and also, I like doing research by research doesn't mean that doing the work kind of research by research. I mean, when I have interested in something, no matter in music or in buying some stuff or the go workout, I always do a lot of work. to deeper my understanding on that to know some basic things behind that I always do do those kind of things. Yeah. yeah, if there is something else you you feel
Interviewer: Like. What about when you are at work? Are you a more goal, oriented person, or are you kind of laid back or like? Do you always want to learn new things, or do you prefer to like? Do what are you already good at
Participant: I always excited to face some new challenges and and when something I I feel like I'm already familiar enough, I gonna feel tired of doing that over and over again. So I always want to try something new and learn something new. yeah, I think that
Interviewer: Okay. I think that's pretty much The next part, we want to talk about your online shopping behaviors and preferences. So can you recall a recent online shopping experience on Amazon, like you, may refer to your order, history.
Participant: Yeah, my recently, let me let me try to open the Amazon. Let's take a look because I am already. Have I? I used to have the prime, but I don't have it now.
Interviewer: Okay, maybe you can just pick one that you have something to say
Participant: Okay? Pick one. Yeah. So for example, like this on the nail polish, I recently got fascinating to buy some nail polish to decorate my nail. And I bought 2 bottles of different colors of nail polish, and I I learned this 2 colors from the another app little red book. And I saw the poster says this one is looks pretty. And I feel like, Okay, I'm gonna search it online on Amazon. And they do have it, and and that is on discount. So I just ordered it immediately
Interviewer: Okay? So you said that you learned from the another app. So did you do any other research like, did you search any articles on Google or those kind of things before you started like looking up those things on Amazon
Participant: Yes, actually, I did, because I when I wanted to buy the nail polish. The 1st thing is, I go to target because there's a lot of options. So I I prefer to buy things immediately when I want them. So when I go to target, and I look at the shop and pick some of the colors I like, and and those 2 colors when I go to the target I didn't see them. So and I also go to the Cvs. They don't have those 2 colors as well. So kind of. I've already looked through the local stores, and they are not available, so I ordered it from the Amazon
Interviewer: Okay. So how long did you did it take to make that purchase like from the time that you decided to buy it until you made the order
Participant: You mean? Let's choose specific colors.
Interviewer: Yeah.
Participant: No, I feel like it. Maybe within 2 days
Interviewer: Okay.
Participant: Yeah, it's like the 1st day I saw those 2 colors. I like it. I like them. And I went to Target and Cvs, and I found there was no available. Then the next day I next day I feel like I looked at the the post again, and I feel like, I really like this color. So I searched it on Amazon and ordered it
Interviewer: Okay, so did you narrow down any products or something like when you are searching on Amazon
Participant: Narrow. Yes, I I only searched the brand for this nail polish. I like this brand. I, all of my nail polish are are from this brand and I I don't want to buy from other stores, but they're official stores. So either this brand and click into their store and go through their colors
Interviewer: Okay? So so when you are searching on Amazon, you have already got the 2 specific colors in mind, and you just directly find find them right
Participant: Yes, but also I when I go through the colors from their store, I also trying to find some other colors. I might like But I didn't find 1. 0, actually, I find one. But I go to target again and buy that one, because there's that one is available in store
Interviewer: Okay. But why did you just buy, buy Amazon, together with other colors?
Participant: Yeah, that's a good question. That's because that one is not on discount and target that there is a discount. So I went to target
Interviewer: Okay? So let's see, yeah. So when you have you, when you were buying those nail polish things, what factors do you care most
Participant: I care. The 1st thing is I want to know is this, not it's this from the official store. It is not a fake one or something that's gonna harm me on my nails. And the second thing is, I I cared about the the shipping speed like I said, I choose, prefer to buy it from the local stores instead of on on Amazon online, because I have to, because I don't have prime member. So I have to wait like the whole week, to receive the package
Interviewer: Okay? And what about price? So you mentioned that you want? Always think that is in discount.
Participant: Yes, yes, I always comparing the price because I don't need them in a very hurry. Kind of so when I can compare the price I I just did. And I choose to buy different cultures from different stores, and you get it from the best price I can have
Interviewer: Okay? And like, what else do you typically buy on Amazon, like what categories? And are there any other factors that affect your decision for these different categories
Participant: Yes, I also buy a lot of cat stuff on Amazon like cat food some cat, the the wet cans and some toy or some food, food, machine food, feeding machine, or like. What? What's this? The cat leader scoop and some cat window perch. Oh, yeah, I bought so many things for my cats and cat toothbrush cat toothpaste, something like that
Interviewer: Yeah. So for the cat stuff, do you have any specific things that you care
Participant: Yeah, I feel like when I go through my shopping list. I feel like a lot of things I booked from Amazon is from the little red book I read that is highly recommended like, and they highly recommended this food. Recommend this toothpaste. They said, their cats love this tool as a toy or something, so I just search it on Amazon and booked that
Interviewer: Okay, I see. So for the nail polish purchase. Did you read any reviews before making the purchase
Participant: Yeah.
Interviewer: Amato
Participant: Oh, oh, you mean on Amazon Review
Interviewer: Yeah, yeah.
Participant: I I didn't specifically for the nail polish, but I do for other purchase like for the cat. Because one thing, one reason I feel like is that I kind of know the quality because they're all the same brand. So the quality should be the same and the color. I've already seen it from the little notebooks, so it should be good as well. So I don't have anything wanted to learn from the review but for other other purchases, like the the some cat toy, or some bigger stuff I might look at, especially the pictures to see how they really look like
Interviewer: Okay, so so when you are reading those reviews, do you usually use the sorting or filtering features? Or you just look at the reviews presented by Amazon
Participant: Oh, I you mean reading the Re. Oh. you mean future reviews or the future, the products
Interviewer: I mean the filter reviews, like
Participant: Oh!
Interviewer: Usually like. They have some options like maybe sorting by rating, sorting by type. Kind of do you usually use them
Participant: Yes, I always choose review with images.
Interviewer: Okay.
Participant: Yeah, I prefer to read this reviews with real pictures in it. So that that makes me I feel like I can read more from from that kind of reviews
Interviewer: Okay, got it. So do you usually read negative reviews?
Participant: Oh, I do especially for something I really want, but I I don't know if that is good or not, so I will choose the like 2 stars or one star reviews to see what is the reason that they don't like this product. And if there's some some reasons, for example, the shipping speed is too slow, or the the package is damaged, those kind of thing not related to the quality of the product. Then I feel like this kind of thing. I don't care about that. I could still buy that product
Interviewer: Okay, I see. So usually, do you have any specific negative reviews that affect heavily affect your decision?
Participant: Yes. especially when the reviews reflect the quality of the product like it seems good, but actually it has very cool quality, and those kind of thing, or some components are very easy to damage, or this going to be hard to your body or something like that, I would definitely close the window. I would not buy that
Interviewer: Okay, got it. So and also. did you, when you are searching on Amazon, did you pay attention to the sponsored products? Do you know that they are ads
Participant: Oh, yeah. So I always feel like there are 2 same product. One says, sponsor the others no sponsor mark on that. So sometimes I was like, what is that which one should I click but later on my friends told me when you click the sponsor one, then the ambulance gonna pay it from the ad. This is an advertisement. Now, I was like, Oh, okay, next time when I go through that, I will not on purpose. Click the sponsor one, I will choose the other one without a sponsor, even though they are the same
Interviewer: Okay? So like, when you are, see, when you saw those kind of ads or sponsored products, how do you think about them? Do you think they are relevant to what you are searching for? And also, do you think that? How do you think about their quality?
Participant: So I don't So for those kind of products I will. It will make me more wanted to read the reviews, especially those with the pictures. Because, I want to say, is there this? Really? It's gonna make me have a doubt that this product is really that good, or this is, just buy some good reviews and make it looks fancy. So the advertisement made me even more adopt the product itself.
Interviewer: Okay? So so basically, do you think that they are kind of like, do you have any? Maybe? Do you have any stereotypes that. Oh, yeah. So basically, they are ads, so they could be of lower quality, or they just pay for they just pay to Amazon so that they can get a higher ranking, or like Those kind of stereotypes
Participant: I feel like for me. I don't, because sometimes I know the product is good, and I want to order that again, like I've already ordered that before, and I feel like I find that. Oh, this one is like a sponsored again, like this kind of thing happened. And I say, okay, you've already that good. Why do you buy the advertisement like, it's not necessary. But yeah, I still buy that
Interviewer: Yeah. So basically, if that's gonna like, the sponsor products is already good. Or like, you have some good experience with it, you can. You still may like interact with it, and also buy it, regardless of whether it is sponsored or not. Right
Participant: Yeah, once I have some very good experience on our product, I will buy it again. No, no matter, I don't even read the reviews or some other things. I just buy it
Interviewer: Okay, got it. ","### Demographic Information

So first, st can you tell me a little bit about yourself, such as, what kind of work do you do? Which city do you live in do you live this live together with other family members, or alone?
Participant: I do academic research in Boston, and I live alone
Interviewer: Got it? So you mentioned you do some academic research. Can you tell me what a typical day looks like for you in your work?
Participant: A typical day
Interviewer: Yeah.
Participant: Well, having research meetings, doing some writing codes with the experiment. They're writing papers
Interviewer: Okay, sir. So about your academic research in Boston. Can you tell me a little bit more about it, such as what are the most important activities you do most of the days? What duties do you have? And what kind of research topics are you working on?
Participant: I don't. I don't know what you mean by most important activity research meetings, important. But paper writing is also important. There's no more or less between these 2. And what's the other half of the question?
Interviewer: It's fine. Just wanna get to know more about what you normally do at work.
Participant: Right. I I just explained. I have research meetings, I talk with collaborators, write papers, write codes, and do experiment. That's pretty much what I do
Interviewer: Okay, got it. So do you mind to tell me a little bit more about what kind of research topics are you working on like general topics, fine
Participant: Human computing action and natural language processing
Interviewer: No. 2, you know, and maybe after work, what do you do after work?
Participant: I stay at home or travel around either way.
Interviewer: So.
Participant: Maybe more specific. I said, when I stay home, I just maybe watch videos on Youtube. And if I tremble around I just go somewhere else to enjoy better weather. Something like that
Interviewer: Okay, got it. So maybe during your weekdays. Would you do after work? Just stay at home only
Participant: Right. I well, I work till midnight, so there is no
Interviewer: Cool.
Participant: Working hours.
Interviewer: Got it. That's interesting. So what kind of person are you at work? And also in after work? Life, for example, are you a goal, oriented person, or kind of laid back sometimes, or maybe you always wanted to learn new things. or such as in daily life, are you extroverted person or introverted being rational or emotional. That kind of description
Participant: It, it's hard to say. Is there any like scope cause what kind of person is hard to describe? Oh, I think, like you mentioned goal or intended goal, or intended that could be true. and export new things. That could also be true. But I don't know if there's any other options
Interviewer: It's not like I offer you some options just like the 1st thing you you would think of when you try to describe yourself at work, and also in after work, life
Participant: I don't know. How. How should I describe? How should I describe myself?
Interviewer: maybe. Yeah, we can talk more about the goal oriented part. Can you? Elaborate more on that? Any examples or, yeah, anything you want to share
Participant: I I don't know what's the like. Do you want to explain why I believe I'm goal oriented person
Interviewer: So we can start with that
Participant: So I don't how to describe that like, if you have a project, need to do everything, I just do everything. If that's something classified as goal oriented. That could be. But, for example, if you're saying like. I don't know I find it hard to classify like a person in a way, cause maybe you'll be goal oriented in one project. Maybe you will not be goal oriented in another project. I I just find it hard to classify myself. I do like work with other people. I I do like make sure I can finish the project within the timeline. but I don't know how to classify myself appropriately with a certain like word or category
Interviewer: Got it. That's also useful. So maybe we can say in real life, Are you extroverted or introverted person?
Participant: I would say introvert
Interviewer: How do you have any examples or
Participant: Well, I don't like social interactions. I don't like social activities, and I don't. I don't prefer. I don't like to engage in social networking if I have, unless I have to
Interviewer: Okay, I got it. That's kind of interesting. So that's so much for the personality part and the next section I'll ask you some questions about your online shopping behavior and preferences. So firstly, can you recall a recent online shopping experience on Amazon? You can refer to your order history. I'll wait until whenever you're ready. It's all bigger
Participant: On Amazon. Are you also, including, like whole food, or just Amazon website?
Interviewer: Just the Amazon Amazon website
Participant: Oh, I bought 3 a lifecycle dot
Interviewer: Okay? You said.
Participant: Hypothesis.
Interviewer: Oh, okay, can you tell me more about that purchase like, what was the situation? What did you want to buy? In the 1st place, that's what you want to buy. How did you find the one you want? And how did you make the decision
Participant: Oh, I just want to buy some for the research for the research experiments. And we want an Alexa, and we wanted to be able to placed in the room, like maybe in a meeting room size, and it can just clearly capture all the people's voices and be able to talk with people. So we don't. I? Just search, Alexa Echo. And there are a few options. Some has screen, some are more expensive, some are less of I don't remember. I don't remember which one I don't remember why I choose the one I bought. I think I don't need a screen functionality. So I just exclude those. I don't need those. I just find the wise, the cheapest, and it seems to be functional.
Interviewer: Got it? So did you do any research before that shopping where you just start to look at the Amazon echo dots after you search for that term
Participant: I did the search. I searched Alexa Echo first, st and I found there are different alternatives. So I believe I went to Google and search. Let me see, I think I searched something like Alexa recording quality, something like that. And there's articles like comparisons about the recording qualities of different Alexa devices, and I think I found there. The most cheapest. One does not have the on par performance as the others, and I think the most previous one is Alexa Dot, or something. It has less speakers and less mics. So I think I choose the one just slightly above the the regular Alexa Echo, because it seems from those articles is the most. It's the best performing one, and it's the still the cheapest, so interesting
Interviewer: Got it
Participant: So I just went back to Amazon. Choose the one I want, and by the amount I need
Interviewer: So other than the reporting quality, this kind of functionality. Are there any else factors that we can about when we make these searches
Participant: Price. I think that's the only thing I care about Price and the
Interviewer: But
Participant: Recording quality. I don't care about the color, because that's for research purposes. I don't care about the screens, because I don't need it. and I can. I cannot think about other other functionalities I would care about. So I just compare these 2
Interviewer: Oh, got it. That's interesting. Maybe. Are there any other kind of such electronic device that will have the same functionality? Have you ever considered those where you just directly, because you want the Amazon echo? So you quite that brand
Participant: Right. We only want it because we have been working with this device for a long time. I just wanna continue the research. So we are stick with particular device. but particular like the platform that I go. But which device I did like the research I just I just talk about. But I don't consider other like Google home things I know
Interviewer: Got it. Got it? Thank you. So what else do you normally buy on Amazon?
Participant: Let me let me see my let me see my purchase history. So I normally buy like shampoo face moisture, and those kind of and toothpaste those kind of daily use. Items
Interviewer: Got it so many necessities. So do you have any other factors that you care about? Should you make those purchases
Participant: Yes. Well, I do some research about which product I want. Not on Amazon. But I just do research on the other platform like, I search for articles, red notes on Youtube, on Bilibi, or whatever people will have videos and and like post about about what they recommend and reasons. I just look through those documents. Do some research myself. find the ones I want to use and just buy it, try it. And if that's something I think is something I need. I'll use it, and once I finish using that, I will buy again.
Interviewer: So you like to buy from some familiar brand or familiar items
Participant: Right, maybe the 1st time. I don't know if that's something I want, but after I've used it I think that's good. I'll stick with it
Interviewer: Got it. That's helpful. Maybe. Do you buy other things on Amazon, like electronics or clothes, or
Participant: Nope, I always buy electronics directly from what I've like the the production companies cause I would assume they have the best like customer protections. They have the best policies for return or for fix
Interviewer: And okay, so did you read any reviews before making the apple, Doc purchase
Participant: No.
Interviewer: Why?
Participant: Because I don't care. Why would I need to review
Interviewer: Because, you mentioned that you care about the recording quality. And you did some research. So I normally, some people may read reviews from the Amazon as well. So I guess you just. You don't really care about that right
Participant: No, I I do the research myself. So that's why I think I prefer to trust myself on the research I did instead of other people's like reviews.
Interviewer: Cabinet. So do you read any reviews for your other filters?
Participant: What? What's the question?
Interviewer: Any necessities for your if you buy the shampoo or face moisture, do you read reviews on Amazon for those purchases
Participant: No, no, I don't read reviews. If a particular product has very low like review average review score, I would just
Interviewer: So it's
Participant: Don't purchase it. If it has, for example, at least maybe 4 stars out of 5. And that's something I after I do the research. I think that's a product I want. I'll just buy it. I will not. I tend not to read those reviews, because I trust the the research I did
Interviewer: Got it. Okay, so do you pay attention to those sponsored products? Do you know they're asked
Participant: To what?
Interviewer: For example, when you
Participant: Okay.
Interviewer: Yeah.
Participant: No, I'll just skip through that cause. I know they are sponsored, and from my understanding, sponsored, I just they paid money to get higher rank in the list. But it doesn't necessarily mean people like it doesn't necessarily mean they are of better quality. So I just skip through that. I ignore all those sponsor things.
Interviewer: So have you ever considered the possibility that is sponsored, and maybe something you want? But you just think maybe you have some negative impression of the sponsors with that
Participant: Right think I think I believe
Interviewer: Yeah.
Participant: Sponsored ones will also show in the regular list. but later it will not show at the top. The sponsor is just an additional like highlighting this playoff item at the very top. Even I just ignore that. That will still show at the very show afterwards, like when I scroll down. It'll show somewhere in the regular list. But at that time it is not being highlighted as sponsored. So I think, by comparing that with the other other similar items in a similar like view. I can. I can better know if that's something I want or not, and normally, from my experiences the sponsored one are not the ones with the most purchase or not, not the ones with the highest quality. Highest reviews. Review ranks. So I just tend to ignore those things, and just directly go to whichever like ranked highest aside from those sponsor ones
Interviewer: That's really helpful. Thank you.","### Demographic Information
